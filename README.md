## Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with:
- Sets, relations, functions
- Big-O notation
- Propositional logic (AND, OR, NOT)
- Graphs (vertices, edges, paths)

## How to Read

Start with file 01 and work through in order. Each chapter builds on the previous one. Key definitions are boxed, and proof sketches are clearly marked.
